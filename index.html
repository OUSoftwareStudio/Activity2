        <h1>Activity 2</h1>
        <p>In this activity you will each create your own website. When your website is completed you will
            add the link to your website under your name. </p>
        <p>You can do this by cloning this repository, creating a branch to edit in your website link, and then creating
            a pull request
            so I can view your changes and mark you as completed.
        </p>
        <p>For this assignment I only require html and css static pages. If you would like to use react to get some
            practice for the final stage
            feel free to do so. As far as hosting your website you can do so through github pages, in the same way this
            website is hosted. Or you
            may use whatever hosting services you desire.
        </p>
        <p>If you have any questions feel free to contact me. I can help you with react, or html and css. Don't be
            afraid to use AI or Google too.</p>
